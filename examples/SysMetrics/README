                       IPFIXIFY YOUR SYSTEM METRICS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description : Collect CPU, Memory, Microsoft EventLogs, and process details
              from Microsoft Windows Servers. Linux statistics of a similar
              nature can also be collected.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implementation Steps:

1. Copy ipfixify.cfg to the same directory as the IPFIXify agent files

2. Modify the ipfixify.cfg file and change the collector directive at
   the top to the COLLECTOR_IP:PORT of the IPFIX Collector.
   
3. Review and update the other settings in your ipfixify.cfg according
   to your environment.

4. Updated the ipfixify.cfg embed encrypted credentials with a local
   and/or remote system access acount by executing the following
   command:

   COMPILED
   
   ipfixify.exe --credentials /path/ipfixify.cfg
   
   UNCOMPILED
   
   perl ipfixify.pl --credentials /path/ipfixify.cfg
   
5. For windows users: If you would like to collect netstat related
   data on remote machines, download the Psexec.exe file from
   systerminternal tools.
   
   http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897553
   
   Copy Psexec.exe to the desired location. This is not required for
   deployments to acquire local statistics only.
   
   Psexec.exe is not required nor is compatible with Linux.

6. To verify that the data is being exported properly, run the following
   command from the IPFIXify directory:
   
   COMPILED:
   
   ipfixify.exe --config=path/ipfixify.cfg --sysmetrics \
       --psexec=path/Psexec.exe --verbose
   
   UNCOMPILED:
   
   perl ipfixify.pl --config=path/ipfixify.cfg --sysmetrics \
       --psexec=path/Psexec.exe --verbose

   Please specify the absolute path to the ipfixify.cfg. --psexec is
   only required if you wish to collect netstat data on remote
   systems.

7. IPFIXify can (but not required) start as a service to automatically
   collect data whenever the system restarts.
   
   It's highly recommended to compile IPFIXify.exe into a binary
   
   Windows:

      ipfixify.exe --install auto --name="SVCNAME" --sysmetrics \
         --config=path/ipfixify.cfg --psexec=path/Psexec.exe

   Linux:
   
      ipfixify.exe --autostart=y --name="SVCNAME" --sysmetrics \
         --config=path/ipfixify.cfg

   Replace SVCNAME with a short desciptive name and specify the
   absolute path to the ipfixify.cfg and psexec if applicable. All 4
   parameters are required.

   NOTE FOR WINDOWS DEPLOYMENTS: Because Windows relies on NTLM for
   the current session to remotely grab Windows EventLogs, the service
   will need to run as a user who can remotely access the members in
   the ipfixify.cfg. By default, LOCALSYSTEM does not have sufficient
   rights. If you do not want to collect EventLogs, then the service
   can run as the LOCALSYSTEM user.

Once IPFIXify is running, reference the IPFIX Collector's Application
to report on the data.
